use of cron job
for ex we want to delete the carts which are older than 3 months in our ecommerece
we can write a cronjob which basically to configure to run it everyday,everymonth or every week and we can delete that.
when we want to send remainder email for thr customer based on some data we can write some cronjob which can run everyday,everymonth or every week and send email to the customer

job - holds the business logic which needs to be executed at some point in time
cronjob - holds the reference of the job(CronJobModel)
trigger - holds the reference of the cron job and helps us to define schdule

trigger and cronjob has a one to many relation
a cronjob basically can have n number of triggers where we can configure at certain point in time 
and this the predefined the itemtype 

req:disable all customer who are not active for 1 year

steps
1.identify whether we need to create a itemtype or not
2.based on that identification either we create itemtype if required extending cronjob model
3.create java class which extends abstractjob performable
and override perform();
4.make the class as spring bean
5.link job and cronjob
6.link the trigger and trigger

why do we need to create a itemtype when we have a cronjob model provided by hybris
to add a additional attributes and use those additional attributes in our custom logic
