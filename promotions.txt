promotions

in promotions basically in hybris it is designed on rule engine which is drools
so drools is seperate framework which basically used for creating rules.

what rule engine does is to define a conditon and action
conditon + action is called promotions.
so that conditon and action creation is provided by rule engine so that we can create a promotion

for promotion management and executing the action and all hybris is using the promotion engine 
so we can create a promotion using this promotion engine and that promotion engine will use the rule engine 

if order(cart) total is >300 then give 10% discount  or >500 give free coupon
here conditon -> order total > 300
action -> give 10% discount

so every promotion in hybris we create it go into cart lvl promotion or product lvl promotion or customer lvl promotion

cart lvl promotion - we are going to give promotion based on the cart value
promotion is based on cart total

product lvl promotion - promotion is based on products/categories
it means we buy 1 product we get another product as free which is pogo promotion  buy 1 get 1 

customer lvl promotion
target customer group

hybris ootb has provided so many templates already so these promotion templates we can use and create any number of promotions based on the conditon and action.

backoffice -> promotion search -> promotion templates

order threshold - this template will be used by marketing team when the cart value reaches a certain limit and we give free coupon

to see the templates go to backoffice->promotion template ->set of templates 
to reuse a promotion template go to conditoni and action tab and click on create a promotion using this template and we need to give the name for our rule

to check the our created promotion go to backoffice->promotion rules -> search {our rule name}

how to publish our promotion?
in rule properties we have to change the status from unpublished to publish in order to active in the storefront
