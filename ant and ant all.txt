When we do ant clean all command from command prompt,it will do

1) Check folder structure

It first checks the folder structure of Hybris installed directory.

It checks whether config,log,data,temp etc folders are available inside hybris folder.

If this folder structure is not available then it creates the folder structure

If this folder structure is already available then do nothing.

2) If there is no build, It will create a build from scratch, if there is any build exist, It will delete and recreate it.

Ant all

1) It assumes folder structure is already exist

2) If there is no build, it will create a build from scratch, if there is any build exist, it will modify it rather than recreating it.

Itâ€™s advisable to use ant all more frequently for building the Hybris platform.

Use ant clean all during the first time setup or if some changes are not reflecting even after doing ant all.

Otherwise ant all should be fine for building hybris platform.

Ideally ant clean all does everything what ant all does and it also performs some additional tasks.
