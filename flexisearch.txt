flexi search

flexible search only used to searching the data in the database.
or getting the data from the database.

for storing the data to the database in hybris we have modelservice
using the modelservice.save method we save the data to database.

item type code -> item.xml - table
attribute - qualifier - column

select * from customer - sql where customer is table

select * from {customer} where customer is item type code
any item type that we are going to refer in the flexi search will have curly brackets that is mandatory

select name from customer where name is the column name and customer is the table name

select {name} from {customer} where name is the qualifier name and customer is the item type code name

to get the count of customers select count{*} from {customers}

flexible search in hybris can do it in 2 ways

select * from {Order as o} where (to_char({o:creationTime},'YYYY-mm-dd hh24:mi:ss') >= ('2010-12-28 23:59:59')) and (to_char({o:creationTime},'YYYY-mm-dd hh24:mi:ss') <= ('2020-01-17 10:00:00'))

2.one to many
select {u.name},{a.postalcode} from {user as u join address as a on {a.owner[qualifier name of source which we mentioned as one]}={u.pk}}

3.many to many
