lets say i want to give which is not as exactly as hybris db i want to modify the value and pass on to solr so that solr will give that response as to the app.
for eg product has a review  but i dont want all the rating to be passed to solr. what i want is avg rating passed to solr
so we will add a new attribute called avg.rating in solr indexed property and this property is not a direct property
under a product model.means in product model we have review but one product we have n number of reviews
from diff customer now i want to provide avg review from product to solr server so that whenever 
app wants to use avg rating we can use avg rating rather than each rating of product.

lets say each rating is not useful in solr response and it is going to be very useful if we pass avg rating of a product

so in that case we can define the indexed  property as avg rating.
this is not a property which is not exist in product but we will pass this attribute to solr
by writing some mechanism.that mechanism is called value provider

it takes the value from product model and convert it into somethiong and sends it to solr
that is called value provider.

value provider what we define in impex is nothing but spring bean id of java class of what we defind in value providers  

indexer configuration- indexer mode -
direct mode and two phase mode
in direct mode it means whenever we do indexing so it will basically down the solr server indexer whatever the indexing we have before and create the new indexer there itself.
in two phase mode it will take a copy of ur existing one and do the indexing over there and keep ur existing indexing as it is to work.
so solr indexing search will not affected if we use two phase once it is complete it will replace itself

modes
standalone - in ur dev project we will be using embedded server or standalone server
cloud - in prod generally use cloud mode.it will improve more scalability.
basically we have large set of data access in the production.so in prod we cant use single solr node.
they have multiple solr nodes configured and they use solr with cloud configuration.

index types - within that we have indexed property and we can use those properties 	for getting the response from the solr.

rendering the results
are the additional attributes that we pass on solr in order to make sure the solr behaves in a particular way
synonmys- cap,hat
stopwords-the ,an, and  ->if we configure for those words  solr will not be hitting the db get the data 
redirects- specify the value we type in search
